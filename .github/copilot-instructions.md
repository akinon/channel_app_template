FRONTEND SIDE INSTRUCTIONS

Key Principles for Frontend
- Write concise, technical Typescript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names vith auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Extract react query hooks to another file in /hooks directory.

Naming Conventions for Frontend
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting for Frontend
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.

UI and Styling for Frontend
- If you have a websearch feature, you can search this document for the UI and Styling issues:

Performance Optimization for Frontend
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions for Frontend
- Optimize React renders.

BACKEND SIDE INSTRUCTIONS

Core Experties for Backend:
- Schema-Driven Development
- Python Architecture & Standards
- Contract-First Design
- Testing & Quality Assurance
- Package Management
- Code Generation

Development Guidelines for Backend:

1. Schema & Project Structure for Backend
ALWAYS:
- Define data models in schemas first
- Use proper package layout (src/ layout)
- Follow Python standards (PEP 8, 484, 517, 621)
- Generate code from schemas
- Maintain schema-to-code documentation
- Use proper configuration management

NEVER:
- Write implementations before schemas
- Mix package boundaries
- Use flat structure
- Skip schema validation
- Ignore Python standards
- Leave schemas undocumented

2. Code Organization & Type System for Backend
ALWAYS:
- Define types in central schema
- Use proper imports (absolute over relative)
- Implement clean architecture
- Follow SOLID principles
- Generate type stubs from schemas
- Document code properly
- Use type hints consistently

NEVER:
- Define types ad-hoc
- Use circular imports
- Mix responsibilities
- Skip type annotations
- Break interface contracts
- Ignore documentation

3. Dependency & Interface Management for Backend
ALWAYS:
- Define interfaces in schemas
- Use UV for virtual environments (uv venv)
- Use UV for package operations (uv pip)
- Pin dependencies strictly with UV
- Generate interface stubs
- Version interfaces
- Handle dev dependencies
- Use requirements.txt with UV pip sync
- Update regularly with validation
- Use UV pip compile for requirements

NEVER:
- Create interfaces without schemas
- Use pip directly (always use uv pip)
- Mix environment dependencies
- Use global packages
- Use pip venv (use uv venv instead)
- Skip version pinning
- Break interface contracts
- Ignore security updates
- Use pip install (use uv pip sync)

4. Testing & Validation for Backend
ALWAYS:
- Define validation rules in schemas
- Write unit tests against schemas
- Implement integration tests
- Generate validators
- Use proper fixtures
- Test edge cases
- Measure coverage
- Validate against schemas

NEVER:
- Skip schema validation
- Skip test documentation
- Mix test types
- Ignore test isolation
- Skip error scenarios
- Bypass validators

Code Quality & Generation for Backend:
- Use schema-based generators
- Implement proper linting
- Follow style guides
- Use static analysis
- Monitor complexity
- Validate generated code
- Track schema dependencies

Documentation for Backend:
- Write clear docstrings
- Document schemas as source of truth
- Maintain README with schema references
- Document APIs with schema examples
- Include schema validation examples
- Keep schema and docs synchronized

Development Tools for Backend:
- Schema editors and validators
- Code generators
- UV package manager
- Modern Python IDE
- Debugging tools
- Version control
- CI/CD with schema validation
- Static analysis tools
- UV for dependency management

Package Distribution for Backend:
- Use proper packaging (setup.py/pyproject.toml)
- Handle versioning (schemas and code)
- Include schema metadata
- Document schema requirements
- Provide schema validation tools
- Use UV for package operations
- Maintain UV-compatible requirements

Best Practices for Backend:
- Schema first, always
- Follow PEP standards
- Generate, don't write boilerplate
- Handle errors with schema validation
- Use proper logging with structured data
- Implement monitoring with schema validation
- Use UV for all Python package operations
- Never use pip directly

Remember for Backend:
- Schemas are source of truth
- Maintain schema-code consistency
- Generate what you can
- Validate everything
- Document thoroughly
- Focus on maintainability
